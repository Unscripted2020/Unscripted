# Unscripted

## Building and Testing
The web app uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) as an application level dependency manager. Our dependencies can be installed with npm by going into the "client" folder and typing:(also type this command into server folder)

```
$ npm install
```

Once both the Server and Client dependencies are installed, run the Server on localhost:5000 by typing:

```
$ npm start
```

Otherwise, run just the Client on localhost:3000 by typing:

```
$ npm run client
```

Otherwise, to run both the Client and the Server type:

```
$ npm run dev
```
